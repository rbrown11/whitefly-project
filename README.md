## Counting whitefly using edge detection and hsv thresholding ##

Small GUI to automatically count flies on images 

To do list:
- Add 'crop image' and display the cropped version instead of original
- Keep the previous hsv filter results to prevent continuous thresholding
- Export results in a csv to make batch processing more efficient
- Display the edge detection working so it can be visually checked by the user
